About me
======

Currently, I'm a senior undergraduate student at the University of Toronto, majoring in Computer Science, I will be graduating Fall 2021.

I’m broadly interested in geometry processing, physics-based animation, computer vision and machine learning application in those 3 fields.

During the third year in undergraduate study I have made a publication related to k-means algorithm. In later years I have worked with Prof. [Alec Jacobson](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~jacobson/) on projects in field of geometry processing and Prof. [David Levin](http://142.93.146.228/researchdb/) on projects in field of physics-based animation.

<div>
<div style="font-size:15pt"><strong>Texture Transfer Based on Neural Implicit Representation</strong></div>
</div>
<div style="font-size:12pt">Texture synthesize and transfer has been a popular topic
in recent years, this projects aims to develop a novel method of texture 
synthesis and transfer based on a neural implicit representation of arbitrary 
object and provide a robust tool that would allow transfering such object as 
texture to arbitrary target surface. </div>

<div style="font-size:15pt"><strong>An Approach Toward Human Musculoskeletal System Simulation</strong></div>
</div>
<div style="font-size:12pt"> Human musculoskeletal system is a complicated system and is affected 
by many factors such as muscle strength, bone stiffness, mass, etc. 
To simulate such system as a whole is very complicated, so is it possible 
if we start on something simple such as a basic unit of bones and muscle 
and build the more complex system based on this unit? This project aims 
to build very simple and basic unit of a Musculoskeletal system and 
simulate such unit. The model will be based on very simple objects 
such as mass points, rod, and springs to represent bones and muscle.
We also applied machine learning method for fast approximation of state 
of the system.</div>

<div style="font-size:15pt"><strong>Accurate Large Scale Ferrofluids Simulation</strong></div>
</div>
<div style="font-size:12pt"> Ferrofluid has a lot of interesting appearance when placed under a magnetic 
field. The most significant one is the formation of complex spikes. This 
shape is usually hard to create by artist in animation. Despite the use in 
art, ferrofluid can be used in a variety of engineering area due to its 
physical properties. This project provides a implementation of ferrorfluid
simulation based on paper “On the Accurate Large-scale Simulation of Ferro-
fluids” by Huang, L. etal.</div>

<div style="font-size:15pt"><strong>Anime Art Style Picture Super Resolution Network</strong></div>
</div>
<div style="font-size:12pt"> Image Super resolution is a well-studied topic in computer vision, involving 
mainly the problem of re-obtaining lost information while doing scaling up. 
This project focuses on the super- resolution of a specific group of images 
with anime art style, including both denoising and scaling up. Due to the 
specialness of anime art style, instead of using traditional large-scale 
deep Convolutional Neural Network, I use a much smaller scale neural 
network with less layer and trainable parameter but at the same time 
achieve comparable result with higher efficiency. </div>
